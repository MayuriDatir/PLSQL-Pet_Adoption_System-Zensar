Project Description: Pet Adoption Database Management System
    The Pet Adoption Database Management System* is designed to efficiently manage pet adoption processes using Oracle's PL/SQL technology. This system automates core tasks such as tracking available pets, managing adopter details, recording adoption events, and generating insightful reports.

Key Objectives:
1. Data Organization: Store information about pets, adopters, and adoption events systematically.
2. Status Management: Update and track adoption statuses for pets and adoptions.
3. Automation with Triggers: Notify users of status changes automatically.
4. Reporting and Analytics:* Generate comprehensive reports for informed decision-making.

System Features:
- Pets Table: Stores details about pets, including their species, breed, age, and availability status.
- Adopters Table: Maintains adopter information such as name, contact details, and address.
- Adoptions Table: Tracks adoption records, linking pets to adopters along with adoption dates and statuses.
- PL/SQL Function: Updates adoption status and ensures pet status is synchronized accordingly.
- Trigger Mechanism: Automatically logs updates when adoption statuses change.
- Reports: Provides insights into pet availability, adoption records, and monthly adoption trends.

Workflow:
1. Data Entry: Pets and adopters are added to their respective tables.
2. Adoption Process: Adoptions are recorded, and statuses are updated dynamically.
3. Automated Alerts: Adoption status changes trigger notifications.
4. Reporting: SQL queries generate actionable reports for management.

Benefits:
- Streamlined data handling and organization.
- Real-time updates and automated alerts.
- Improved transparency in adoption processes.
- Enhanced decision-making through analytical reports.

This project serves as a robust foundation for pet shelters, animal welfare organizations, and adoption agencies to manage their operations efficiently using Oracle PL/SQL.
